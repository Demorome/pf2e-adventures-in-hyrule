# Adventures in Hyrule - Foundry VTT Module Implementation
 A module implementation for Aoife's Adventures in Hyrule homebrew: https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/wXO8Df9X-adventures-in-hyrule
 
 Currently includes all ancestries, all archetypes, backgrounds, class options, and animal companion + familiar options but not much more. Note that this is all as of v1.01 of the homebrew.
 
# Requirements
 For parts of the animal companion feats to work properly, the PF2e Animal Companion module is required: https://github.com/TikaelSol/PF2e-Animal-Companions
 
 # Installation
 - In Foundry VTT, click "Install Module" and at the bottom of the pop-up, input this Manifest URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Demorome/pf2e-adventures-in-hyrule-foundry-vtt/main/module.json 
 - Don't forget to enable the PF2e Animal Companion module!
