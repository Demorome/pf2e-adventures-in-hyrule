Secretive to a fault, the sheikah population has thinned over the millenia, but small populations can still be found in hidden villages or secretly integrated with Hyrulean society. Famed for their stealth, technological prowess and powers of divination, sheikah most often serve as spies and advisors.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Secreted away in their villages or working behind the scenes in hylian cities and towns, most sheikah go their entire lives without their true identity being discovered to an outsider. So rare are the sheikah seen that many believe them to be entirely extinct, and that is not entirely untrue - the population of sheikah has been slowly dwindling ever since the surface was invaded by demons. Nonetheless, those who yet live carry on multiple-millenia-old traditions of honour and in some cases even still possess the technological knowhow of their forebears.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who lives in secrecy, carrying the weight of history on their shoulders, you should play a sheikah.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Create an elaborate alternate identity, or perhaps multiple, that you use in public.</li>\n<li>Possess a glut of wisdom on various topics from divination and shadow magic to technology.</li>\n<li>Have trouble opening up to others, preferring to guard your emotions carefully.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you to be a hylian, or at least disbelieve any claims of sheikah ancestry.</li>\n<li>Fail to understand your strange perspectives on the modern world.</li>\n<li>Assume that you are loyal to all Hyruleans because of your people's history.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Tall and slender, with light - often white - hair, pointed ears and red eyes, the sheikah find it relatively easy to pass for a hylian with little effort. However, their bodies' supreme flexibility sets them apart from most other humanoids.</p>\n<p>Compared to hylians and humans, the sheikah are long-lived, under natural circumstances living to be around 150 to 200 years old. In some cases, however, the sheikah use ancestral magic to extend their lifespans until a certain goal is achieved, at which point they fade away.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most sheikah live either in hidden villages or within the walls of Hyrulean temples and palaces, and have sworn undying loyalty to the royal family of Hyrule as part of an agreement made with the goddess Hylia. A few sheikah break away from this tradition, however, and strike out on their own amongst wider society. Rarer still are those who form heretical clans of bandits and assassins, though when they do infamy is sure to follow.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Most sheikah follow a strict code of honour, resulting in a tendency towards lawful alignments. In addition, those who remain loyal to their ancestral promise to guard Hyrule's royal family tend towards good. The Yiga and other bandit groups, though evil, still retain a form of honour system, meaning they overall tend towards lawful evil.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>The sheikah have long traditions of subterfuge, honor and spirituality, and their adventurers usually reflect this. Especially common are sheikah rogues, monks and fighters, all of whom operate in a distinctly sheikah fashion, following esoteric codes. Some sheikah have honed their minds so well that they become psychics, while others dabble in shadow magic, resulting in a number of shadow sorcerers and laughing shadow magi. A handful of sheikah choose instead to study the artifice of their ancient past, becoming inventors, construct summoners or even gunslingers.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Sheikah who live in traditional hidden communities use ancient names passed down for hundreds of generations, though those who integrate with another community tend to adopt the traditional names of that community in order to fit in.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Impa, Fanadi, Goma, Kasuto, Kohga, Miu, Purah, Sooga, Tutsuwa, Zuna</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Sheikah Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 30 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw </strong>Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Sheikah</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Able to travel to and from the Minish Realm only once every century, the discovery of a minish in Hyrule is rare indeed. Though tiny in size, the minish are known to subtly influence the affairs of Hyruleans for good or ill, and it is therefore a common superstition that the minish are behind events both fortuitous and disastrous.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Believed to only reveal themselves to the pure-hearted, especially children, the tiny minish are seen as more myth than fact in many places within Hyrule. Sometimes mischievous and sometimes helpful, the minish are a flighty ancestry with a keen interest in the affairs of larger ancestries. Amongst their many strange customs is the creation of <em>kinstones</em>, tiny medallions which the minish split in half, hiding each half in a different place. It is said that if these fragments are found and reunited, various magical effects can occur.</p>\n<p>If you want to play as a mysterious and curious spirit of fortune that views the world from a different perspective, you should play a minish.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Live alongside unsuspecting humanoids, helping or playing pranks on them.</li>\n<li>Have a large collection of kinstone fragments that you have accumulated over your travels.</li>\n<li>Form powerful bonds with others, even if they aren't aware of your existence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you to be just a myth, and act surprised upon seeing you.</li>\n<li>Assume you are completely purehearted and selfless.</li>\n<li>Believe you are to thank or blame for various chance-based occurrences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Minish are outwardly mouse-like, with snouts, clawed feet and beady eyes, but also possess long ears and sometimes an even longer tailfeather, giving them an altogether alien appearance. Minish usually have fair hair and pale skin, expressing their differences more through their choice of clothes than genetic variation.</p>\n<p>The natural lifespan of a minish is around 150 years, with most minish therefore only experiencing one opportunity to cross to or from the Minish Realm in their lifetime.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Minish tend to form close-knit communities, understanding that strength in numbers is often necessary for their survival. Urban minish, however, usually live in more loose collectives due to the relative safety of living amongst larger peoples. Most communities of minish are led by an elder, who is usually the most knowledgable amongst them.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Although the minish are rarely strongly religious, they tend towards good alignments, and an evil minish is extremely rare. Mountain minish are often lawful, forest minish are often axiomatically neutral and town minish are often chaotic, though there are some exceptions to these rules.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Minish adventurers explore a world much larger to them than most others. Their traditions of magic and artifice mean that many minish adventurers have training as wizards and, in the case of town minish, inventors. Forest and mountain minish more regularly become druids and occasionally rangers specialized in their home terrain. While their size normally works against them becoming effective martial combatants, they are highly resourceful, perceptive and stealthy; a natural fit for investigators and rogues.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Minish names are mostly varied, consisting of two or three syllables, although a near universal quality of them is that they end in the letter 'i', or sometimes 'o'.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Belari, Ezlo, Festari, Gentari, Kokari, Librari, Melari, Pelati, Temto, Vaati</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Minish Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Tiny</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw </strong>Strength</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Minish</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Nonetheless, their fearsome reputation means they can often be found working as mercenaries for hire, especially in the service of draconic creatures for which they feel a certain kinship. Not all lizalfos follow the isolationist traditions of their compatriots, however, and some have managed to integrate themselves in Hylian society (though must battle the ire of their kind to do so).</p>\n<p>If you want to play as a character with both sharp fangs and a sharp mind, you should play a lizalfos.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be quick to act, for better or worse.</li>\n<li>Follow an ancient tradition of martial prowess.</li>\n<li>Fight tooth and nail to protect your home and loved ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Act guarded around you, at least until you prove trustworthy.</li>\n<li>Assume you are the servant of a powerful dragon or similar being.</li>\n<li>Appreciate you as an unfailing ally, even in the face of overwhelming danger.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Standing taller than the average human, a matured lizalfos possesses a long tail, fangs, and a body covered in scales.

As a result, lizalfos tribes are often coming into conflict with other ancestries due to their close proximity.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Whether they live in close proximity to a draconic being or not, most lizalfos pay some degree of respect towards dragons and their ilk, and this is reflected in their most common choices for worship, usually being a draconic spirit of some variety. Lizalfos are rarely truly good or evil, and have a social tendency towards law that stems from brutal utilitarianism. This can vary, however, when a tribe resides near a draconic being that they worship, instead tending towards that being's alignment.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Although leaving their tight-knit communities for any extended period is rare among the lizal, those that choose (or are forced) to do so create similarly strong bonds with their adventuring party, treating them like a family. Lizal fighters often use advanced weaponry, and lizal inventors usually create innovative new weapons. Their draconic connection means that many lizal adventurers are draconic instinct barbarians, sorcerers with the draconic bloodline or even witches who serve patrons they believe to be dragons. Others still favor the path of the ranger or monk, utilising their survival instincts and natural weapons more than any formal training.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Lizalfos are notorious for having names that prove difficult to pronounce by non-lizalfos creatures due to their reliance on vocalizations produced by organs that they lack. As a result, lizalfos that regularly mingle with others either take on simplified versions of their names as nicknames or use a title instead.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Axetail, Dyna, Firewing, Iiga, Khami, Skree, Stonefist, Toka</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Lizal Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 30 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Lizal</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Sometimes, however, a kokiri is allowed to leave under special circumstances. In these cases, they usually serve as explorers, chroniclers and diplomats representing the wild places. With their childlike appearance, pointed ears and boundless curiosity, they are often able to live undetected amongst hylians at least until their unaging nature is discovered.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Positive and playful, curious and energetic, the kokiri may have the appearance of children but are filled with all the wisdom, reliability and bravery that one expects of an adult. Rarely is a kokiri predisposed to violence, preferring love to war if at all possible but, should the need arise, they do not balk in the face of danger. Many of Hyrule's taller ancestries view the kokiri as a novelty and, due to a lack of understanding, may treat them like children if they are ever discovered. Many kokiri use this misconception to their advantage, be it for getting away with mischief or - in the exceedingly rare case of an evil kokiri - more sinister things.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who always sees the positive in a situation, is highly energetic, and who is easily underestimated, you should play a kokiri.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find it difficult to focus your attention on one subject for very long due to your energy.</li>\n<li>Find yourself in trouble often thanks to your boundless curiosity and general naivety.</li>\n<li>Make friends easily, even to the point of swearing lifelong oaths on a whim.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you are simply a hylian child, even if you tell them otherwise.</li>\n<li>Find you exceedingly fascinating and probe you with unsolicited questions.</li>\n<li>Understimate both your physical and mental capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kokiri look much like hylian children in most aspects, but differ in a few key respects. The kokiri retain the same appearance for all of their lives, always appearing youthful, thanks to the cyclical nature of their existence. Kokiri hair colours range from brown to blonde, with green shades being a somewhat uncommon variation. </p>\n<p>Kokiri are effectively ageless as long as they remain in the protection of their creator, the Great Deku Tree, but those who leave the forest will eventually 'fade away' - a fate shared by those who suffer the loss of their incarnation of the Great Deku Tree.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The only place known to host kokiri in any significant number is the aptly-named Kokiri Forest, dominion of their creator and protector, the @Compendium[pf2e-adventures-in-hyrule.pf2e-adventures-in-hyrule-deities.Za4vYGG8vAHrjS38]{Great Deku Tree}. Though it may be possible for kokiri to be created by other great trees, no instance of this occurring has yet to be documented. Within the Kokiri Forest, the kokiri live in relative peace and harmony, threatened only by forest creatures, organised into a loose hunter-gatherer collective.</p>\n<p>Kokiri social lines are mostly egalitarian, with no social classes to speak of, though some kokiri may attempt to assert dominance over others on the basis of the perceived importance of their assigned roles - in truth, however, all roles are equally important to sustaining kokiri society.</p>\n<p>The kokiri almost universally reject modernity and its trapping, with a special resentment towards industrial activity, a belief stretching all the way back to their origins.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Due to their divine creation by a spirit of good, kokiri are rarely evil, and those who do stray particularly far from good alignments only do so due to outside interference. The childlike, carefree nature of the kokiri also leaves them disposed towards chaotic alignments, although nearly all kokiri respect the 'laws of the forest' laid down by the Great Deku Tree. Similarly, it is rare for a kokiri to worship anything other than their great tree, but those who leave the forest may discover a wide pantheon of deities that appeal to their flighty nature.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Though few kokiri opt to become adventurers as it requires them to give up on their immortality, those who do usually do so because of their powerful curiosity or a desire to do good in the wider world. Because of their natural talents and unique bond with nature, kokiri adventurers are usually druids, rangers or rogues, but witches with primal patrons and summoners with plant or fey eidolons are also common.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kokiri names are universally simplistic, traditionally given by the Great Deku Tree to them upon their creation. Often, these names consist of two melodic syllables, although three-syllable names have been observed in rare instances. Interestingly, those with these longer names often discover innate magical powers at some point in their lives, suggesting an unfathomable naming scheme of some kind.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Dora, Doremi, Fado, Fugo, Mavu, Mido, Mila, Saria, Sosu, Tifa</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Kokiri Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Deku</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Instead, gerudos tend to be neutral but pragmatic by nature, willing to use methods that others would call evil in order to secure the survival of their people. This includes swearing fealty to evil deities, especially demon lords, in exchange for protection. Other gerudo communities instead align themselves with non-evil gods of protection, warfare and magic.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Due to their social emphasis on survival by any means necessary, gerudo adventurers carry a reputation for being unscrupulous in their methods, but this is only partially true: gerudo warriors are highly disciplined, and only resort to unethical measures as a last resort. The strict training of a gerudo warrior translates to many gerudo adventurers becoming champions, fighters and monks, whilst their spies and assassins usually become investigators and rogues.

Their faith tends to reflect their connection to the forest, with most koroks practicing some form of druidic or spiritualist belief. Of course, the most commonly revered deity is the Great Deku Tree, but koroks who live further afield may adopt the worship of deities of nature local to them. Koroks are very rarely evil, and usually fall to the path of evil only in the most dire of circumstances.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Koroks have a deep curiosity for the wider world, leading to a good number of them walking the path of an adventurer for little greater reason than to see more of the world. Their reverence of nature and deep spirituality means that druids and clerics are common among their number, and their far-travelling tendencies encourage many to become rangers and wandering bards. Some koroks place a great deal of belief in 'lucky' trinkets, which sometimes produces a korok thaumaturge.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Korok names tend to follow the trend of their kokiri ancestors', being short and rarely more than two syllables long. Unlike the kokiri, however, their names regularly make reference to different kinds of plants, usually being one which the korok feels a certain connection with.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Aldo, Chio, Damia, Drona, Elma, Hestu, Hollo, Irch, Kula, Linder, Maca, Makar, Oakin, Olivio, Peeks, Rown, Walton, Zooki</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Korok Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw </strong>Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Deku</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

But above the Sea of Clouds, many of the constructs they built still operate to this day; their guards standing vigil over long-forgotten sanctuaries, their stewards endlessly repeating a task assigned to them by a long-dead operator. But, sometimes, within this ceaseless cycle a construct can develop a spark of awareness, becoming an independent and sentient being.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Made out of the marvellous material known as zonaite, the zonai construct is perhaps the crowning technological achievement of the prehistoric zonai civilization, a fully automated servant created for and specialized in a singular task of the creator's choosing. Those rare constructs who have developed an independent intelligence over the millenia vary greatly in their personalities, but many dedicate themselves to new pursuits with the same degree of devotion expected of them by their creators; this time, however, they forge their own paths to their own destinations.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is a living machine capable of utilizing unique and powerful technological abilities, you should play a zonai construct.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Specialize in a single task almost exclusively, applying it wherever possible.</li>\n<li>Have an urge to assist others by sharing your knowledge and talents.</li>\n<li>Have a degree of empathy for constructs of all kinds, or even for inanimate tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mistake you for a mindless automaton.</li>\n<li>Marvel at the technology behind your existence, perhaps seeking to study you.</li>\n<li>Have trouble relating to you due to your inhuman appearance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>The overall shape of a zonai construct varies based on its constructed purpose, though several 'stock' models exist for common tasks. All zonai constructs possess limbs made of magical energy, generated by their internal core, which are contained by rings made of zonaite. A zonai construct may have tools or weapons built directly into its frame, and an awakened zonai construct may further modify itself over the course of its life.</p>\n<p>Provided it receives regular maintenance, a zonai construct can theoretically survive indefinitely. However, because the technology of the zonai has largely been lost to history, most zonaite constructs are reduced to scavenging for replacement parts as they slowly degrade over the eons, eventually breaking down for good.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The only large 'communities' of zonai constructs exist on those forgotten sky islands once inhabited by the zonai, but these groups still consist almost entirely of the mindless variety of construct. When a zonai construct in such a group awakens an intelligence, it must struggle with either feeling alone among its kind or abandoning its intelligence and returning once more to a life of endless, pointless servitude.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>The very concepts of morality and religion are new to any freshly-awakened zonai construct, but the practice that religion often involves - servitude to a master you believe to control your destiny - is nothing new to them at all. Depending on their perspective, a zonai construct may either be drawn towards or pushed away from religion. For those zonai faithful, their deities of choice are usually related to their specialized task; for example, a zonai construct created to be a gardener may find the @Compendium[pf2e-adventures-in-hyrule.pf2e-adventures-in-hyrule-deities.Za4vYGG8vAHrjS38]{Great Deku Tree}'s teachings appealing.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Zonai constructs most commonly become adventurers for little reason other than to escape from the limited world that their life previously encompassed. Because of their specialized abilities, a zonai construct may be uniquely suited a particular class, or they may adapt their existing talents to a new field. The technological expertise that often arises from being a technological being themselves means that of all the classes, zonai constructs tend towards alchemist, gunslinger and inventor.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Before they gained their independence, most zonai constructs were never given names.

Though it is said that the temperament of a deku scrub varies based on the type of tree it is born from, they share a near-universal suspicion of outsiders. Conversely, they are also known for their canny business acumen - it is not uncommon to find a deku scrub plying their wares in or around a major city.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Born from magical trees deep in wooded areas, deku scrubs are deeply tied to the natural world, and many live their entire lives within the proximity of the tree they were born from. Deku scrubs are often suspicious of outsiders and therefore slow to build trust with others (especially humanoids), likely due to their connection with the land.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is connected to the natural world and utilises their unique physical adaptations, you should play a deku scrub.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold a deep suspicion of others, especially city-dwellers, until they prove themselves.</li>\n<li>Have a keen eye for good deals or an urge to ply your own wares.</li>\n<li>Be quick to change your approach when the current situation isn't ideal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Act warily around you, as if expecting unprovoked aggression.</li>\n<li>Assume you possess expert knowledge of the natural world.</li>\n<li>Misinterpret your pragmatism for cowardice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Deku scrubs vary in size, but the majority of them are diminuitive, standing at about 2 feet tall with stubby limbs and large heads. Though deku scrubs express gender, they do not possess any physical sexual characteristics. Their bodies consist of bark, often wreathed in boughs of leaves which act as a natural form of camouflage, and they possess glowing orange eyes that enhance their sight in dim light.</p>\n<p>Born without arms, deku scrubs reach maturity after a few years, during which time they develop both arms and their characteristic leaves. Deku scrubs typically live to be around 25 years old, and their leaves continue to grow throughout their lifespan.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Though many deku scrubs live solitary lives within their woodland homes, in some places where large numbers of deku scrubs are born they form hierarchies up to and including entire kingdoms. However, even where deku scrubs form larger societies, they never expand out from the wooded region they are formed, instead banding together to fortify their collective home once their territory is secure.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Deku scrubs tend towards neutral alignments, but can ultimately be of any alignment, usually matching that of other deku scrubs born from the same grove of trees. In terms of religion, deku scrubs hold deep traditions venerating deities with a link to the natural world, especially those that promise protection for their homeland.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Adventuring deku scrubs are keen pragmatists with a quite literal link to the natural world. As a result, martial deku scrubs usually take on the role of a ranger or rogue, while spellcasters are often druids or primal sorcerers who inherit their powers from the land itself. Merchant scrubs who become adventurers often leverage their charisma, and sometimes their inventory, as thaumaturges who collect esoterica through trade.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Deku scrubs rarely use names amongst their own kind, instead referring to each other by profession or function within their hierarchy. It is not uncommon, therefore, for the monarch of a deku community to simply be named 'King' or 'Queen'. When interacting with outsiders, however, they usually adopt monikers to make those interactions easier - often this results in uncreative names that are simply some variation of 'Deku'.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Baba, Decci, Dekki, Deppi, Mokwa, Sosca, Tomsa, Wikki, Yves</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Deku Scrub Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Deku</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Though most hylians do not possess innate magical abilities, hylians are best known for their proficiency in magic and artifice as well as a deep connection to the forces of destiny. They are also a people whose history is fraught with bloody conflict both within and without their mighty kingdoms and many hylian territories still bear the scars of these wars.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Spread throughout various kingdoms and even other planes, hylians are a diverse people possessing incredible ambition (for good or ill) and a unique connection to the gods. Their long ears are said to allow them to hear the voices of deities, though with rare exceptions this is mostly a metaphor for their near-ubiquitous religious devotion. Hylian history is littered with examples of 'fated' heroes and villains, and this has led to the widespread belief that hylians are a people destined to greatness.</p>\n<p>It is said that in the past, hylians were all able to wield powerful innate divine magic, but over millennia that ability has faded.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who possesses great potential and a unique connection to the divine, you should play a hylian.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe that you are destined towards some great fate, guided by the gods themselves.</li>\n<li>Build strong friendships with others, regardless of their backgrounds.</li>\n<li>Possess exceptional ambition, even at the expense of your safety or security.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think that you look down on them, especially if they are human.</li>\n<li>Believe that you possess divine powers, even if you do not.</li>\n<li>Distrust your ideas for being too ambitious or worry about your ultimate intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Hylians appear similar to humans, but possess long pointed ears, and generally have blue or blue-grey eyes and light skin although wider variation has been observed outside of central Hyrule, where they are most populous. Hair colours also vary, usually being shades of blonde or brown but more exotic colours such as red and purple are not entirely uncommon.</p>\n<p>Hylians mature and age at roughly the same rate as humans.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Although hylians can be found living in a wide variety of social structures, they most commonly form kingdoms ruled by absolute monarchs. Bloodlines are highly important to hylians since sorcerous powers are known to be passed down through families, and this is especially true of the royal family of Hyrule, who are said to be direct descendants of the goddess Hylia.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>The vast majority of hylians are polytheistic, revering a whole pantheon of deities, and often take to one particular deity associated with their region as their patron deity. Capable of both heroic good and villainous evil, hylians are known to run the whole gamut of alignments.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Hylian names vary based on the region they are born in, and have some degree of crossover with human naming conventions. Hylian names often seem to be corruptions of human names from the same region, but this is actually false - the human names are in fact corruptions of hylian names.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Agitha, Aryll, Beedle, Daphnes, Groose, Gustaf, Harkinian, Kaepora, Link, Malon, Osfala, Owlan, Peatrice, Rhoam, Shad, Telma, Zelda</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Hylian Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Two free ability boosts</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong> Hylian</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it’s positive).

{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/tengu.svg","name":"Twili","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p><em>Once an ancient group of hylians known only as the Interlopers, the twili were created through centuries of exposure to the shadowy magic of the twilight realm, in which they were imprisoned indefinitely. Though many twili made peace with their lives in the prison plane, some believe that they are owed freedom to rejoin the world of light and work to escape. Regardless of the outlook of an individual twili, a measure of their clan's dark sorcerous power lives within each of them.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Existing neither entirely within the light or within the darkness, twili often struggle to find a home outside of the twilight realm, though rarely one will both have the means to escape their imprisonment and a desire to settle in the world of light. As an adventurer, a twili character is assumed to be one such being.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character that moves between worlds with confidence and possesses a measure of innate shadow magic, you should play a twili.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strongly fear imprisonment or loss of freedoms.</li>\n<li>Instinctively stick to the shadows, finding the sun too harsh on your eyes.</li>\n<li>Seek out forbidden knowledge or magical items.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Regard you with curiosity, especially if you have a more unusual form.</li>\n<li>Assume that you are a powerful sorcerer who wields evil magic.</li>\n<li>Expect you to be a loner or hermit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Physically speaking, twili's forms are exaggerated in comparison to their hylian forebears, often being especially tall and spindly or short and stout. Their skin varies between ashen grays and pale blues, with variable amounts of flesh covered by darkened sections and glowing markings unique to their clan. Their eyes, which lack pupils, glow with shades of red, orange or yellow. The natural hair colour of all twili is auburn, the only aspect of their original forms untouched by the twilight.</p>\n<p>Many twili are centuries old, their transformation in the twilight effectively extending their lifespans - and sentences - in perpetuity.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Within the twilight realm, the twili are organised under a monarchy which seeks to sway their people away from their villainous past and towards a peaceful existence. Outside of that plane, it is extremely rare of a twili to meet another of their kind, and rarer still for them to share enough values to cooperate. Their origins as hylians does, however, enable them to integrate quite easily with hylian society.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Although the Interlopers originally worshipped evil deities, especially those with the darkness domain, centuries of isolation without divine assistance has largely embittered them towards religion. Nonetheless, a sizable number of twili now walk a path of redemption, and may be found worshipping deities which espouse such values. Similarly, although at the time of their imprisonment the Interlopers were a tribe of evildoers, it is somewhat rare to find a truly evil twili now, though that does not mean there are a large number of good twili either.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>By far, the most common path for a twili adventurer utilises their innate shadow magic, whether that be as a shadow sorcerer, stealthy rogue or laughing shadow magus. Some twili follow a more spiritual path, becoming clerics of deities that focus on redemption, darkness or light. Other twili focus on their emancipation to a great degree, which naturally leads into their training as a liberator or redeemer champion. A twili thaumaturge is especially likely to wield a lantern or mirror implement.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Most twili use names derived from their ancestors' original hylian names, although some twili that live in the world of light will take on pseudonyms to help them evade unfair reprisal for their forebears' crimes.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Argus, Lana, Majo, Midna, Shad, Zant, Zeu</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Hylian Names</span></h3>\n<p>Agitha, Aryll, Beedle, Daphnes, Groose, Gustaf, Harkinian, Kaepora, Link, Malon, Osfala, Owlan, Peatrice, Rhoam, Shad, Telma, Zelda</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Twili Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Ancient Hylian</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).
