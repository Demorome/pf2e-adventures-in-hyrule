Skin colors vary between dark greens and blue-grey.<br /><strong>Horriblin:</strong> Large bulbuous noses, gray skin, long clawed arms and a hammer-shaped horn. Skin colors vary between dark greys and blues.<br /><strong>Miniblin:</strong> Small and rat-like, with curved horns and fur that covers their scalp and lower body. Skin/fur colors vary between pink, green, red, blue and yellow.<br /><strong>Moblin:</strong> Similar in appearance to boars, with tusks and hooves, and a large frame. Skin colors vary between reds, blues and dark browns.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The blin usually form primitive tribes, often known as hordes, led by the biggest or strongest member. When under the command of a more powerful force than any of them (such as Ganon), they will form more complex hierarchies if that force wishes.</p>\n<h2>Alignment And Religion</h2>\n<p>The majority of blins are chaotic evil, worshipping (or at least deferring to) Demise, Ganon or another evil deity. Even among defectors, blins usually retain the chaotic element of their alignment, and are rarely good.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Blin adventurers fall into two categories: defectors and outcasts. In either case, they leverage their combat training. Barbarians, fighters and rogues are likely choices, but some especially crafty blin are contacted by patrons who seek to replace their old master, becoming witches.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>With little sense of individuality within their tribes, blin rarely bother with names, instead referring to each other by their position within the tribe or short nicknames.
