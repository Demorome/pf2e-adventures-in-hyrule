{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/human.svg","name":"Kokiri","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p><em>Wards of the Great Deku Tree, the kokiri are rarely seen outside of their forest home due to their guardian's law against leaving. Sometimes, however, a kokiri is allowed to leave under special circumstances. In these cases, they usually serve as explorers, chroniclers and diplomats representing the wild places. With their childlike appearance, pointed ears and boundless curiosity, they are often able to live undetected amongst hylians at least until their unaging nature is discovered.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Positive and playful, curious and energetic, the kokiri may have the appearance of children but are filled with all the wisdom, reliability and bravery that one expects of an adult. Rarely is a kokiri predisposed to violence, preferring love to war if at all possible but, should the need arise, they do not balk in the face of danger. Many of Hyrule's taller ancestries view the kokiri as a novelty and, due to a lack of understanding, may treat them like children if they are ever discovered. Many kokiri use this misconception to their advantage, be it for getting away with mischief or - in the exceedingly rare case of an evil kokiri - more sinister things.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who always sees the positive in a situation, is highly energetic, and who is easily underestimated, you should play a kokiri.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find it difficult to focus your attention on one subject for very long due to your energy.</li>\n<li>Find yourself in trouble often thanks to your boundless curiosity and general naivety.</li>\n<li>Make friends easily, even to the point of swearing lifelong oaths on a whim.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you are simply a hylian child, even if you tell them otherwise.</li>\n<li>Find you exceedingly fascinating and probe you with unsolicited questions.</li>\n<li>Understimate both your physical and mental capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kokiri look much like hylian children in most aspects, but differ in a few key respects. The kokiri retain the same appearance for all of their lives, always appearing youthful, thanks to the cyclical nature of their existence. Kokiri hair colours range from brown to blonde, with green shades being a somewhat uncommon variation.Â </p>\n<p>Kokiri are effectively ageless as long as they remain in the protection of their creator, the Great Deku Tree, but those who leave the forest will eventually 'fade away' - a fate shared by those who suffer the loss of their incarnation of the Great Deku Tree.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The only place known to host kokiri in any significant number is the aptly-named Kokiri Forest, dominion of their creator and protector, the Great Deku Tree. Though it may be possible for kokiri to be created by other great trees, no instance of this occurring has yet to be documented. Within the Kokiri Forest, the kokiri live in relative peace and harmony, threatened only by forest creatures, organised into a loose hunter-gatherer collective.</p>\n<p>Kokiri social lines are mostly egalitarian, with no social classes to speak of, though some kokiri may attempt to assert dominance over others on the basis of the perceived importance of their assigned roles - in truth, however, all roles are equally important to sustaining kokiri society.</p>\n<p>The kokiri almost universally reject modernity and its trapping, with a special resentment towards industrial activity, a belief stretching all the way back to their origins.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Due to their divine creation by a spirit of good, kokiri are rarely evil, and those who do stray particularly far from good alignments only do so due to outside interference. The childlike, carefree nature of the kokiri also leaves them disposed towards chaotic alignments, although nearly all kokiri respect the 'laws of the forest' laid down by the Great Deku Tree. Similarly, it is rare for a kokiri to worship anything other than their great tree, but those who leave the forest may discover a wide pantheon of deities that appeal to their flighty nature.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Though few kokiri opt to become adventurers as it requires them to give up on their immortality, those who do usually do so because of their powerful curiosity or a desire to do good in the wider world. Because of their natural talents and unique bond with nature, kokiri adventurers are usually druids, rangers or rogues, but witches with primal patrons and summoners with plant or fey eidolons are also common.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kokiri names are universally simplistic, traditionally given by the Great Deku Tree to them upon their creation. Often, these names consist of two melodic syllables, although three-syllable names have been observed in rare instances. Interestingly, those with these longer names often discover innate magical powers at some point in their lives, suggesting an unfathomable naming scheme of some kind.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Dora, Doremi, Fado, Fugo, Mavu, Mido, Mila, Saria, Sosu, Tifa</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Kokiri Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Deku</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Even in places where their bad reputation precedes them, the gerudo are able to move freely due to their close similarity in appearance to hylian women, a fact which they freely exploit.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The most striking feature and well-known fact about the gerudo is that their ancestry consists solely of women, also surprising is their means of procreating - by disguising themselves as hylian or human women, they use their biological compatibility with those ancestries to become pregnant with a new gerudo child, which they carry back to their homeland to give birth to. For this reason, as well as a history of war, hylians and gerudo often come into conflict.</p>\n<p>Some gerudos form nomadic tribes, whilst others build fortresses to live in, but both are mechanisms through which the gerudo keep their people safe; after all, survival is everything to a gerudo.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is a pragmatic, disciplined and skilled survivor, you should play a gerudo.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Put yourself and your allies first, considering others only once you are safe and well.</li>\n<li>Have been trained in magic or martial discipline from a young age.</li>\n<li>Take great pains to avoid garnering excessive attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mistake you for a hylian or human woman, especially if you do not dress traditionally.</li>\n<li>Assume you are up to no good, even when you are on your best behaviour.</li>\n<li>Find you exotic, glamorous or beautiful.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Adult gerudo usually stand around 6 to 7 feet tall with muscular builds and long legs, dark skin tones including tan and olive shades, and bright red hair.

Much of gerudo society is built around the principle of meritocracy as a result, with their most powerful warriors, sorcerers and tacticians becoming community leaders.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Although it is often believed that gerudos have a proclivity towards evil, this is only true in a handful of communities. Instead, gerudos tend to be neutral but pragmatic by nature, willing to use methods that others would call evil in order to secure the survival of their people. This includes swearing fealty to evil deities, especially demon lords, in exchange for protection. Other gerudo communities instead align themselves with non-evil gods of protection, warfare and magic.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Due to their social emphasis on survival by any means necessary, gerudo adventurers carry a reputation for being unscrupulous in their methods, but this is only partially true: gerudo warriors are highly disciplined, and only resort to unethical measures as a last resort. The strict training of a gerudo warrior translates to many gerudo adventurers becoming champions, fighters and monks, whilst their spies and assassins usually become investigators and rogues. Gerudos also have a long history of sorcery and witchcraft, and some blend magic and martial training to become powerful magi.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Gerudo names are polysyllabic and usually carry a meaning associated with positive personal qualities in the language of the gerudo.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Aveil, Estan, Furosa, Konora, Kotake, Koume, Nabooru, Nali, Ramella, Rijo, Rotana, Shabonne, Tali, Urbosa, Yaido</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Gerudo Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Strength, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Gerudo</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if itâs positive).

Although diminuitive, fairies accomplish their goals using innate magical abilities rather than physical strength, and as a result most fairy adventurers are spellcasters. Mightiest among fairykind are the Great Fairies, many of whom are deities in their own right and act as protectors of their smaller kin as well as spiritual leaders.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is an energetic, ever-curious guardian of nature, you should play a fairy.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Commit yourself completely to a cause, protecting it - or them - with your life.</li>\n<li>Find that the secrets of magic come easily to you.</li>\n<li>Talk at great length and often about subjects which fascinate you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Expect you to possess helpful magic, and to be willing to use it for free.</li>\n<li>See your very presence as a sign of good fortune.</li>\n<li>Know very little about fairy society, and therefore find your customs novel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Fairies are winged beings no more than a few inches in height, with the rare exception of Great Fairies which usually stand at 10 feet or more. The coloration of their insectile wings varies, usually matching that of other fairies born in the same place, with most being vivid colors from all across the spectrum. When a fairy glows, it does so with the same color as its wings.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The most common gathering place for societies of fairies are fairy fountains, hidden springs that are usually presided over by a Great Fairy, though some wayward fairies make their homes further afield, hiding in the nooks and crannies of the world.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Almost all fairies are good, with some that live outside of fairy communities being neutral; only very rarely is a fairy truly evil, and those that are find themselves cast out and admonished for their wicked ways. On the whole, fairies are especially devout followers of deities they believe in.

Their powerful devotion and self-sacrificing nature leads to many fairies becoming clerics or champions. Their innately magical nature means that they regularly manifest a divine or primal sorcerous bloodline, and eidolons forge bonds with fairies to benefit from their cooperative instincts, turning them into summoners with an unusually equal relationship between summoner and eidolon.

{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/leshy.svg","name":"Deku Scrub","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p><em>Deku scrubs are a morphologically diverse people closely associated with nature, residing within areas of abundant plant life, such as forests and swamps. Though it is said that the temperament of a deku scrub varies based on the type of tree it is born from, they share a near-universal suspicion of outsiders. Conversely, they are also known for their canny business acumen - it is not uncommon to find a deku scrub plying their wares in or around a major city.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Born from magical trees deep in wooded areas, deku scrubs are deeply tied to the natural world, and many live their entire lives within the proximity of the tree they were born from. Deku scrubs are often suspicious of outsiders and therefore slow to build trust with others (especially humanoids), likely due to their connection with the land.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is connected to the natural world and utilises their unique physical adaptations, you should play a deku scrub.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold a deep suspicion of others, especially city-dwellers, until they prove themselves.</li>\n<li>Have a keen eye for good deals or an urge to ply your own wares.</li>\n<li>Be quick to change your approach when the current situation isn't ideal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Act warily around you, as if expecting unprovoked aggression.</li>\n<li>Assume you possess expert knowledge of the natural world.</li>\n<li>Misinterpret your pragmatism for cowardice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Deku scrubs vary in size, but the majority of them are diminuitive, standing at about 2 feet tall with stubby limbs and large heads. Though deku scrubs express gender, they do not possess any physical sexual characteristics. Their bodies consist of bark, often wreathed in boughs of leaves which act as a natural form of camouflage, and they possess glowing orange eyes that enhance their sight in dim light.</p>\n<p>Born without arms, deku scrubs reach maturity after a few years, during which time they develop both arms and their characteristic leaves. Deku scrubs typically live to be around 25 years old, and their leaves continue to grow throughout their lifespan.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Though many deku scrubs live solitary lives within their woodland homes, in some places where large numbers of deku scrubs are born they form hierarchies up to and including entire kingdoms. However, even where deku scrubs form larger societies, they never expand out from the wooded region they are formed, instead banding together to fortify their collective home once their territory is secure.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Deku scrubs tend towards neutral alignments, but can ultimately be of any alignment, usually matching that of other deku scrubs born from the same grove of trees. In terms of religion, deku scrubs hold deep traditions venerating deities with a link to the natural world, especially those that promise protection for their homeland.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Adventuring deku scrubs are keen pragmatists with a quite literal link to the natural world. As a result, martial deku scrubs usually take on the role of a ranger or rogue, while spellcasters are often druids or primal sorcerers who inherit their powers from the land itself. Merchant scrubs who become adventurers often leverage their charisma, and sometimes their inventory, as thaumaturges who collect esoterica through trade.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Deku scrubs rarely use names amongst their own kind, instead referring to each other by profession or function within their hierarchy. It is not uncommon, therefore, for the monarch of a deku community to simply be named 'King' or 'Queen'. When interacting with outsiders, however, they usually adopt monikers to make those interactions easier - often this results in uncreative names that are simply some variation of 'Deku'.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Baba, Decci, Dekki, Deppi, Mokwa, Sosca, Tomsa, Wikki, Yves</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Deku Scrub Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Deku</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Although numerous, gorons rarely leave their homes except to trade with other ancestries, and since most gorons possess an easygoing and agreeable attitude, they are usually very welcome guests. Between tribe members, or 'brothers' as they affectionately call each other, gorons treat strength as the greatest virtue, and are extremely competitive by nature.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Gorons often appear somewhat alien to other ancestries, be it for the stony 'shells' that grow upon their backs or their proclivity to eating rocks, but in fact gorons are typified by an enjoyment of the simpler things in life. Although gorons tend to welcome outsiders into their isolated communities with open arms, it is rare for others to be able to keep up with the energetic and physically demanding lifestyle that gorons lead, be it working the mines, engaging in tests of strength or dancing into the night.Â </p>\n<p>Due to their obsession with strength, gorons rarely take up professions that do not utilise their muscles in some way, often opting to become labourers, smiths, or guards.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who carries on the long traditions of your family, boasts immense strength and never turns down a challenge, you should play a goron.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Boast about your strength, especially in comparison to others.</li>\n<li>Cherish your friends and family, vowing to protect them to the end.</li>\n<li>Excel at one or more crafts, especially those which are physically demanding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fear your imposing stature.</li>\n<li>Mistake your friendly and welcoming demeanour for weakness.</li>\n<li>Marvel at your unusual diet and strange customs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Gorons are muscular humanoids with wide bodies, thick limbs and a 'shell' of stone that grows on their backs (and sometimes elsewhere on their bodies). Their skin ranges in shades of brown, and sometimes possess lighter body markings that denote their tribe. Gorons do not have distinct sexes and reproduce asexually, though despite this most gorons identify as male, perhaps due to masculinity's association with physical strength.</p>\n<p>Gorons mature by age 20 and typically live to be around 100 years old, and the rocks on their body continue to grow throughout their entire lifespan.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Gorons form close-knit communities in mountainous regions, relying on cooperation within their hierarchies to survive in what are usually dangerous regions of the world. Gorons arrange their tribal hierarchies by a number of factors, and it is not unusual for a tribe to grant honorific titles to its largest, strongest and eldest members.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and religion</h2>\n<p>Gorons value strength, friendship and honor above all else, usually dedicating their entire lives to their tribe. Their focus on hierarchy and family leads the typical goron towards lawful alignments, and their choice of religion tends to reflect this, with a special focus on deities which represent strength or family.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>With their immense natural strength and tendency towards recklessness, barbarian is an obvious choice for a goron, but more disciplined combatants become champions or fighters. Their love of artifice (and explosives) has also resulted in many a goron alchemist and inventor.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Most gorons use simple, disyllabic names but some append titles such as 'Gor' (meaning elder) to their names to represent their position within their tribe.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aji, Bludo, Cooke, Dangoro, Darbus, Darmani, Darunia, Golo, Gorko, Gortram, Naddon, Rohan, Tanko, Volcon, Yunobo</p>\n<h2>Goron Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong>Â Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Strength, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Hylian, Goron</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong>Â equal to your Intelligence modifier (if itâs positive).

They are also a people whose history is fraught with bloody conflict both within and without their mighty kingdoms and many hylian territories still bear the scars of these wars.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Spread throughout various kingdoms and even other planes, hylians are a diverse people possessing incredible ambition (for good or ill) and a unique connection to the gods. Their long ears are said to allow them to hear the voices of deities, though with rare exceptions this is mostly a metaphor for their near-ubiquitous religious devotion. Hylian history is littered with examples of 'fated' heroes and villains, and this has led to the widespread belief that hylians are a people destined to greatness.</p>\n<p>It is said that in the past, hylians were all able to wield powerful innate divine magic, but over millennia that ability has faded.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who possesses great potential and a unique connection to the divine, you should play a hylian.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe that you are destined towards some great fate, guided by the gods themselves.</li>\n<li>Build strong friendships with others, regardless of their backgrounds.</li>\n<li>Possess exceptional ambition, even at the expense of your safety or security.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think that you look down on them, especially if they are human.</li>\n<li>Believe that you possess divine powers, even if you do not.</li>\n<li>Distrust your ideas for being too ambitious or worry about your ultimate intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Hylians appear similar to humans, but possess long pointed ears, and generally have blue or blue-grey eyes and light skin although wider variation has been observed outside of central Hyrule, where they are most populous.
