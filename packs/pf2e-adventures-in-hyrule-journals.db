To replace coins with rupees, the following rules should be applied.</p><p>Instead of splitting the currency into several denominations, only one measure exists: rupees. Although differently-colored rupees exist, exchanging one color for a smaller denomination is assumed to be trivial and therefore it probably isn't worth tracking individual rupee colors in most games. However, you may want to reward the party with a single valuable rupee rather than a pile of green rupees. For ease of reference, a table is provided below with the general value of different colors of rupee across the series.</p><p>Because so many variations of rupee color exist, and tracking them individually is not advised, you should likewise either treat all quantities of rupees as negligible Bulk or simply weight rupees by their total value rather than quantity, with 1000 rupees counting as 1 Bulk; after all, more valuable rupees are often larger.</p><p>When converting between coins and rupees to determine the price of items and services, the easiest method is to simply treat each rupee as 1 gold piece (gp); for goods and services that cost less than 1 gp, you should either round to the nearest gold piece, sell the items in bundles that equal 1 gp, or consider the item free. In settings that are rupee-rich, such as <em>Wind Waker's</em> Great Sea, a rupee may be treated as a silver piece (sp) instead, remembering that 10 sp is equal to 1 gp. In both of these cases, however, issues are raised with activities such as Earning Income, which allow PCs to earn money in the form of copper pieces. To handle such cases, you may wish to pay out with low-value goods and services, or further depreciate the value of a single rupee to that of a copper piece (cp). Note that doing so will cause magic items at higher levels to be priced at extremely large numbers of rupees, with high level items consequently costing millions of rupees.</p><h2>Rupee Values</h2><table class=\"pf2-table\"><thead><tr><th>Rupee Color</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Green</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Blue</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Yellow</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Red</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Purple</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Silver</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Gold</td><td>300</td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Triforce Alignment","type":"text","_id":"vbyqDF8YLdHqxBFc","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>When running games within a <em>Legend of Zelda</em> setting, Pathfinder Second Edition's default alignment rules may not fit the tone you are aiming for; for example, the cosmic battle between Law and Chaos is a topic that the games do not touch on whereas Good versus Evil features heavily in every <em>Zelda</em> story. Triforce Alignment is a variant rule that aims to bring the alignment system closer to what is depicted in the video games.</p><p>When playing with Triforce Alignment, the lawful-chaotic axis of alignment is not used. Instead, every creature and deity is aligned to one (or none) of the ideals represented by the Triforce: Courage, Power or Wisdom. The good-evil axis remains, representing heroes, villains and everyone in-between.</p><p>Alignment damage is adjusted accordingly, with each Triforce alignment's damage able to harm creatures of another alignment: Courage harms Power, Power harms Wisdom, and Wisdom harms Courage.

Most sapient creatures should have a Triforce alignment, whereas all non-sapient creatures, such as animals, should be unaligned.</p><p>The following table lists the deities found in this homebrew and their corresponding Triforce alignments.
